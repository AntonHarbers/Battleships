// before the game begins, the player must place all of his ships:

while a dropdown element is active/selected, when the player hovers over his squares he is shown the possible
placement of the ship (only show the ship hover if that spot is possible for the ship to be placed). 

when player clicks on one of the possible squares, that ship is placed, removed from the dropdown and added to
his active ships array. 

once the final ship is placed the game will begin
